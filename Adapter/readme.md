This is a simple set of classes to show the functions of the adapter pattern. The example taken here is that of a program that maps its input to the buttons of a video game controller, however we want to convert that input at source to that of a keyboard. This is done by wrapping the keyboard driver class in an adapter that exposes the methods of the defined gamepad input class. in this way, the VideoGame class is working with a gamepad interface, but is actually calling the respective keyboard driver methods through the written logic of the adapter.
